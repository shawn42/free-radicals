Todos:
- add more levels!!
- get obstacles working
- base attraction on number of electrons?
- BUG!! shooting an electron really hard can cause it to "escape" the screen, making the level un-finishable

Ideas:
- add charge indicator on nucleus (+/-) size indicates size of charge
- what if electrons are allow to vanish?
- triggers that need you to shoot electrons into them?
- more points for larger atoms?
- fading effect for inert atoms
- flashing effect for vanishing electrons?
- add atom mobility

Notes :
