Todos:
- get level loading work so I can predefine levels
- get obstacles working
- nucleus drawing based on a few small circles
- level win condition (all atoms inert)
- intro mode
- add valence explanation to intro
- inert special fx
- fix forces on electron freeing

Ideas:
- add charge indicator on nucleus (+/-) size indicates size of charge
- what if electrons are allow to vanish?
- more points for larger atoms?
- fading effect for inert atoms
- flashing effect for vanishing electrons?
- add atom mobility

Notes :
electron shells: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas
Z   Element   No. of electrons/shell
2   helium  2
10  neon  2, 8
18  argon   2, 8, 8
36  krypton   2, 8, 18, 8
54  xenon   2, 8, 18, 18, 8
86  radon   2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 8
118   ununoctium  2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 18, 8

x(t) = cos(t) and y(t) = sin(t)
